2. **Join a team**: Find a team to collaborate with during the event. You can join an existing team or create your own.

4. **Collaborate**: Use GitHub's features like issues, pull requests, and project boards to collaborate with your team and keep track of your progress.

5. **Share your work**: When the hackathon concludes, make sure to share your team's project with the judges and other participants.
